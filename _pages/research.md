## Assistive VR Gym: Interactions with Real People to Improve Virtual Assistive Robots [[Paper]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04959.pdf)[[Code]](http://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-vr-gym)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Versatile robotic caregivers could benefit millions of people worldwide, including older adults and people with disabilities. Recent work has explored how robotic caregivers can learn to interact with people through physics simulations, yet transferring what has been learned to real robots remains challenging. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to help bridge the gap between simulations and the real world. We present Assistive VR Gym (AVR Gym), which enables real people to interact with virtual assistive robots. We also provide evidence that AVR Gym can help researchers improve the performance of simulation-trained assistive robots with real people. Prior to AVR Gym, we trained robot control policies <em>Original Policies</em>) solely in simulation for four robotic caregiving tasks (robot-assisted feeding, drinking, itch scratching, and bed bathing) with two simulated robots (PR2 from Willow Garage and Jaco from Kinova). With AVR Gym, we developed <em>Revised Policies</em> based on insights gained from testing the Original policies with real people. Through a formal study with eight participants in AVR Gym, we found that the Original policies performed poorly, the Revised policies performed significantly better, and that improvements to the biomechanical models used to train the Revised policies resulted in simulated people that better match real participants. Notably, participants significantly disagreed that the Original policies were successful at assistance, but significantly agreed that the Revised policies were successful at assistance. Overall, our results suggest that VR can be used to improve the performance of simulation-trained control policies with real people without putting people at risk, thereby serving as a valuable stepping stone to real robotic assistance.</details>

## Active Hierarchical Imitation and Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Tasks [[Report]](https://10d01914-837c-42f4-9cd4-1908566f2b48.filesusr.com/ugd/387059_217c208d7245449d87fd75500383a4bb.pdf)[[Code]](https://github.com/chrisyrniu/active_hierarchical_imitation_and_reinforcement_learning)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>For tasks with sparse reward and long horizon, for example, maze navigation of a complex agent, it is hard to learn applicable policies directly with reinforcement learning (RL). In order to tackle this problem, we propose to use a hierarchical structure. The low-level controller interacts directly with the environment, and the high-level controller generates subgoals for the low-level controller to follow. We propose to use Data Aggregation Method (DAgger) with human demonstrators so that the agent can transfer to new tasks quickly with a pre-trained low-level policy. On top of that, we also test different ways of uncertainty calculation for active learning, and apply it to the DAgger learning process. For the generalizationability of the agent, we experiment on ways to enhance the agent’s perception ability with a computer vision-based method, for example, a visual autoencoder.</details>

## Autonomous Robot for Garbage Grasp and Classification [[Poster]](http://drive.google.com/file/d/1JWhuUt3SpoYBA6qzqesEBO1SvfQiPFfZ/view?usp=sharing)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Garbage classification has always been a focus in environmental protection research. According to a study by Columbia University, Americans trash seven pounds of material per person every single day—that is 2,555 pounds of material per person per year. A large proportion of waste materials are ultimately dumped into landfills or 
burned by incinerators. This one-way treatment without discrimination heavily pollutes our environment and wastes recyclable resources. Changes can be made by us. Our team plans to design an autonomic garbage classification robot which is capable of detecting object, recognizing type of garbage, and putting it into the right category. With the help of robots, we are able to improve the garbage sorting process, reducing recyclable waste and the cost of human resource. Our project is intended to 
stimulate our imagination, to test new concepts that may solve problem with overflowing garbage of the future.</details>

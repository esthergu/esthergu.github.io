I am currently a Master student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Charlie Kemp](http://charliekemp.com/) in the [Healthcare Robotics Lab](http://sites.gatech.edu/hrl/). My research interests lie at the intersection of human-robot interaction, assistive robotics, machine learning and machine perception. I am particularly interested in developing algorithmic techniques to enhance robotâ€™s capabilities of safely assisting and collaborating with people in an unstructured environment.

I previously received B.S.E. in both Computer Science and Data Science at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, where I am advised by [Chad Jenkins](http://ocj.name/) on occlusion-robust 6D pose estimation.

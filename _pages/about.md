I am currently a Master student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Charlie Kemp](https://charliekemp.com/) in the [Healthcare Robotics Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/hrl/). My research interests lie at the intersection of human-robot interaction, assistive robotics, machine learning and machine perception. I am particularly interested in robot learning to safely and efficiently assist people with daily tasks. 

I previously received B.S.E. in both Computer Science Engineering and Data Science Enginnering at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, where I am advised by [Chad Jenkins](https://ocj.name/) on robot perception.
